# The Cross-Platform UE4 Asset Manager & Launcher

Formerly known as UE4Launcher.

**This is a FORK of the [UE4Launcher](https://github.com/nmrugg/UE4Launcher)**

It's a WIP project. The code will be updated and uploaded during the development process

## Purpose

The project is intended to add some new features to the original project.
The goal is to manage assets for UE4 easily.

It should offer:

- asset filtering by tag or category.
- show asset informations: description, tags, engine versions compatibility, prices, sales...
- remove/hide unimplemented features (from the Epic launcher windows version)
- download and installation of assets (same as the original project features)
- make some UI improvements
